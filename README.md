# üì∏ TwoPix ‚Äì A Private Photo Messaging App for Two

## üß† Project Overview

**TwoPix** is a gesture-driven, minimalist photo messaging app made for exactly **two users**. It creates a private space for sharing photos and messages ‚Äî think Snapchat, but stripped down to just *you and your person*. No feeds, no distractions, just connection.

Built with `SwiftUI`, `AVFoundation`, and `Firebase`, the app offers a custom camera experience, real-time chat, and an intuitive swipe-to-send UI. Firebase handles user authentication, image uploads, chat data, and cloud functions.
